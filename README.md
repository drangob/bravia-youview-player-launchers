# Discontinued
Unfortunately I do not have the time to maintain it nor do I have enough knowhow to address issues for newer TVs. So I will be archiving this repo. Please feel free to fork it or otherwise happy to be contacted if you would like to take over.

# bravia-youview-player-launchers

This is a small application that simply adds a icon to the homescreen
to be used with Sony TVs that run YouView:

- BBC iPlayer
- BBC Sounds
- ITV Hub
- All 4
- My5
- UKTV Play
- STV Player

### Why

I'm sure most Sony Android TV users will agree, the Sony Shelf is an
unnecessary app, and without it, the above apps are not accessible
without going through YouView.

This will add icons to Android so that these apps can be launched
without YouView. This does also mean you can disable YouView and still
enjoy these player apps.

Additionally, while personally I like YouView, I'm sure there are people
who have it disabled. This will allow you to access them even when YouView
is disabled.

### Installation

Simply download the latest APK under [releases](https://github.com/hoshsadiq/android-tv-youview-player-launchers/releases)
and sideload the app one way or another.
